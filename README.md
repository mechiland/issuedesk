## Usage ##

``` bash
# Install global dependencies.  Depending on your user account you may need to
# gain elevated privileges using something like `sudo`.
npm install -g grunt-cli bower

# Optionally install coveralls (integration is baked in with Travis CI).
npm install -g coveralls

# Install NPM dependencies.
npm install

# Install Bower dependencies.
bower install
```

The build process consists of numerous Grunt plugin tasks that work together
to optimize your application.

``` bash
# To run the build process, run the default Grunt task.
grunt

# Run a build and test the now optimized assets.
grunt default server:release
```

## Running tests ##

To run tests, simply add `.spec.js` files throughout your application and they
will be automatically picked up by the runner.  You can find example test specs
in the `test` directory.

To run Karma as a daemon:
*Which will automatically run your tests after you save.*

``` bash
grunt karma:daemon
```

``` bash
grunt karma:run
```
